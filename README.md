Project Overview
The objective of the project was to develop a Coffee Sales Dashboard for McKeezy Coffee Shop, focusing on 
finding the following:

2. Sales by country.
3. Top customers.
4. Loyalty Subscription.
Other Key Metrics like Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders, Top Selling Product, that will be deduced.
The dashboard will be interactive, so you will be able to filter by time period, type of coffee roast, coffee sizes, 
and whether or not the customers are loyalty members
